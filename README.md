# Unsupervised Clustering - KMeans 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the application of the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm as part of an unsupervised learning assignment for the RUBA (Recognizing Unsupervised Behavioral Analysis) course.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The notebook walks through the process of:
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Preprocessing data for clustering
- Applying K-Means clustering
- Visualizing cluster results
- Evaluating clustering performance using metrics like Silhouette Score and Elbow Method

## ðŸ§ª Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
